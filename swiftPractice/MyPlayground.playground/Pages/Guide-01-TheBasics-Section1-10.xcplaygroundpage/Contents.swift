// 7.3 UIntÔºöAddtional unsigned integer type, use it only when you specifically need. even when the values to be stored are known to be nonnegative

/** 9 Floating-Point Numbers :  Double( 64 bit ) , Float( 32 bit )
    Double: at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits.
    In situation where either type would be appropriate , Double is preferred.

/**
   10 Type Safety and Type Inference
Swift always choose Double (rather than Float) when inferring the type of  floating-point numbers
Swift always infers that a constant, which appears as a number resebling an integer, is an Int.

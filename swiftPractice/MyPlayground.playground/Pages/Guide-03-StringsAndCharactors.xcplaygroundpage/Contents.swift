 5  Strings Are Value Types
 If you create a new String value, that String value is copied when it's passed to a function or method, or when it's assigned to a consatnt or variable.
 In each case , a new copy of the existing String value is created, and the new copy is passed or assigned, not the original version.
 Value types are described in Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types.
